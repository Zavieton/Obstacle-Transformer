# Obstacle-Transformer
This repo is our paper **Obstacle‚Äêtransformer: A trajectory prediction network based on surrounding trajectories** published on IET Cyber System and Robotics.

## Abstract
Recurrent Neural Network, Long Short-Term Memory, and Transformer have made great progress in predicting the trajectories of moving objects.
Although the trajectory element with the surrounding scene features has been merged to improve performance, there still exist some problems to be solved.
One is that the time series processing models will increase the inference time with the increase of the number of prediction sequences.
Another lies in which the features can not be extracted from the scene's image and point cloud in some situations.
Therefore, this paper proposes an Obstacle-Transformer to predict trajectory in a constant inference time. 
An obstacle is designed by the surrounding trajectory rather than images or point clouds, making Obstacle-Transformer more applicable in a wider range of scenarios.
Experiments are conducted on ETH and UCY data sets to verify the performance of our model.

## Code is coming soon.
